This repository features the library for launching and writing to HMT solidity contracts.

## Setup the library
We support the current version through Docker. We will be adding the pip library in the near future.

In order to build the image you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer.

We have gathered relevant commands in the `bin/` folder.

You can run the project with `bin/prelaunch`.
